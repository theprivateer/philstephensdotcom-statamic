A testament to the power of music to transport you to a different time and place - this album takes me back to my dorm room in my first year at university, staying up late into the night working on projects for my architecture course. The slowly rising bass of the intro to Angel, or Elizabeth Frazerâ€™s ethereal vocals on Teardrop never fail to give me goosebumps.
