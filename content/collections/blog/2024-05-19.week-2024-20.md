Pretty uneventful week. Visited the office (in the city) for the first time in about two months, so took the opportunity to sample coffee from a couple of different cafes in Newstead.

To try and gauge its effectiveness - and also to figure out a better schedule - I stopped intermittent fasting for the week. Will start it up again next week, but perhaps with a different fasting / eating split to figure out what works best for me.

I have relaunched this site (for now, at least) using the [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) CMS. With the launch of the [365 Albums Project](https://philstephens.com/albums) I needed to be pushing updates to Github every day, which got a little cumbersome (static sites are great until you need to schedule posts).

I have repurposed the original theme from this site when it was powered by Jigsaw and trialing [Ploi](https://ploi.io) and [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/39b748fc3bd9) (in the Sydney region) for orchestration and hosting. Whilst it is probably more to do with geography (and the fact I’m _paying_ for hosting) the site already seems a lot more responsive for me, even if it is powered by a (albeit flat-file) dynamic CMS.

As I explore Statamic more I’ll post some thoughts, tips and tricks.
