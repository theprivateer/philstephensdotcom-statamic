I've recently started wearing my first generation ScanWatch (which has a _very_ similar design) again as my daily driver in place of of my Apple Watch Ultra, and so much of this review rings true.

The _only_ things I would disagree with is the critique of the navigation and the digital display (alas the original ScanWatch does not have OLED) - I find the display more than sufficient for what it needs to convey (this coming from an Apple Watch _Ultra_ user) and the navigation is well executed, considering the only means of interaction is a digital crown.

> Get ready for compliments

Funnily enough, just a couple of days ago I was out for lunch with some work colleagues and one of them _did_ compliment my watch (which in turn started a whole discussion about smartbands and watches).
