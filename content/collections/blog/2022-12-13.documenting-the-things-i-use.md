I've been a long time fan of [Paul Stamatiou](https://paulstamatiou.com), and I particularly enjoy his in-depth [gear](https://paulstamatiou.com/stuff-i-use/) write-ups.

I have a [/uses](https://uses.tech) page, but like most people who have jumped on this trend, it is little more than a list of equipment and software that I use for my work.  This often masks a lot of the subtle choices I have made along the way to arrive at my current setup (and the decisions that will inevitably lead to changing it over time).

So I'm going to take a page out of Stammy's book and start to deep-dive into my setup.  This is as much for myself as anyone else who cares to read it - introspection and closer examination of the 'stuff' I choose to possess (and that which I choose to forego) is an important part of the minimalist journey that I am embarking on.

Watch this space!
